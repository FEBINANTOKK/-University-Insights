## Overview

The "Study MBBS Abroad" landing page is designed to provide a seamless user experience for prospective students seeking information about studying medicine abroad. The page is built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**, ensuring responsiveness, interactivity, and fast loading times.

## Design Process

1. **Wireframing**:

   - The layout was designed to prioritize key information, such as the benefits of studying MBBS abroad, top countries, and the admission process.
   - The hero section features a bold call-to-action (CTA) to encourage user engagement.

2. **Color Scheme**:

   - A gradient color scheme (`#1e3a8a` to `#2563eb`) was chosen for the header and hero section to create a cohesive and modern look.
   - Neutral backgrounds were used for content sections to ensure readability.

3. **Typography**:

   - Sans-serif fonts were used for clean and modern typography.
   - Font sizes and weights were adjusted to create a visual hierarchy.

4. **Animations**:
   - Subtle animations (e.g., floating cards, spinning icons) were added to enhance interactivity without overwhelming the user.

## Development Process

1. **HTML Structure**:

   - Semantic HTML tags were used to improve SEO and accessibility.
   - The page is divided into sections: Hero, Why Study MBBS Abroad, Top Countries, Admission Process, and Lead Form.

2. **Tailwind CSS**:

   - Tailwind CSS was used for rapid prototyping and responsive design.
   - Custom animations and gradients were added using CSS.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - The page is lightweight and optimized for fast loading.
   - Images are compressed, and unnecessary scripts are avoided.
